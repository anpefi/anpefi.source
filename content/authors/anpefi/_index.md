Hi! I'm Andrés Pérez-Figueroa, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR)](https://www.ciimar.up.pt) in Portugal. My current research here aims to decipher the adaptive forces in cancer evolution acting at the ultimate level of resolution, the single-cell. My background  is related to conservation and population genetics as a computational biologist. I can write code (not very well) to simulate and analyze biological data for understanding its evolutionary implications.
