abstract = "The mussels *Mytilus edulis* and *Mytilus galloprovincialis* are marine organisms with external fertilization able to hybridize where their distributions overlap allowing the study of reproductive isolation mechanisms in nature. We provide raw data of a transcriptomic analysis of mature male gonads from these two Mytilus spp. using NGS (Illumina) technology and a preliminary list of transcript that were functionally annotated showing species-specific differential expression. A shortlist including some of these genes and their corresponding proteins have been thoroughly analysed and discussed in Romero et al. (2018, In press)."
