      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve changed the website design. For the last 2 years this site was relying on the Jekyll framework using the Minimal Mistakes template. But recently I started to dive deeper in Rstudio, rmarkdown and the tidyverse ecosystem. Few days ago I discovered in Twitter about the new Yihui Xie&amp;rsquo;s package called blogdown that allows to create static websites using Rmarkdown and Hugo. After a quick read of the Xie&amp;rsquo;s book about this package I decided to change this website from Markdown+Jekyll to Rmarkdown+Blogdown+Hugo. Of course, the migration is quite easy as my website was almost empty and unchanged for these 2 years. In fact, this decision was boosted by the fact that I was trying to update Jekyll and found some troubles with ruby dependences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the site was used to look in the last 2 years.
&lt;img src=&#34;img/posts/old.website.png&#34; alt=&#34;old layout&#34; /&gt;
Now, I use the Academic template that I think looks great for a site like this. However, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I am going to tweak it a bit more to fit some of my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
